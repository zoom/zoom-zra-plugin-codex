# Zoom

Zoom is a Codex plugin for connecting Codex to Zoom meeting context and for planning, building, and debugging Zoom integrations. It helps engineers search live Zoom context, choose the right Zoom product surface, shape implementation plans, debug failures, and route into Zoom API, SDK, webhook, bot, and automation references without reading the full Zoom doc tree first.

## Plugin Shape

This repository is packaged as a Codex plugin:

- plugin manifest: [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](.codex-plugin/plugin.json)
- Zoom app mapping: [`.app.json`](.app.json)
- local marketplace metadata for sideload testing: [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](.agents/plugins/marketplace.json)
- deterministic command workflows: [`commands/`](commands/)
- focused reviewer agents: [`agents/`](agents/)
- reusable workflows and references: [`skills/`](skills/)
- branding and screenshot assets: [`assets/`](assets/)
- local sideload guide: [`sideload.md`](sideload.md)

This plugin contains the Zoom app connector mapping, local developer guidance, commands, skills, reviewer agents, and branding assets.

## What Zoom Does In Codex

Use `Zoom` when you want Codex to:

- search Zoom meetings by topic, attendee, or content
- retrieve summaries, transcripts, recordings, and related meeting assets
- pull meeting context into coding, documentation, or follow-up workflows
- choose the right Zoom product surface for an integration
- build Zoom REST API, SDK, webhook, WebSocket, bot, and automation workflows
- debug Zoom auth, event delivery, SDK, and API issues

## Local Testing

For local sideload testing, see [`sideload.md`](sideload.md).

## Using In Codex

Codex can use this plugin through the Zoom app connector plus command, skill, and reviewer-agent surfaces:

- install the plugin from `/plugins`
- authenticate the Zoom app connector when Codex prompts for it
- mention the plugin as `@Zoom` if the UI exposes it
- use natural language requests that need live Zoom meeting context
- use slash commands for deterministic flows such as `/setup-zoom-oauth`, `/debug-zoom-auth`, `/debug-zoom-webhook`, and `/zoom-integration-doctor`
- invoke a bundled skill explicitly with `$skill-name`, for example `$start` or `$setup-zoom-oauth`
- describe the task naturally and let Codex route into the right skill

The Zoom app connector auth is managed by Codex. It is not exposed as a shell environment variable or raw bearer token.

If a newly installed skill does not trigger in the current thread, start a new Codex session so the plugin metadata reloads.
