## Hard Guardrails

- Gate calls behind readiness (`zoomCampaignSdk:ready` or `waitForReady()`).
- Do not call `show/hide/open/close` before SDK initialization.
- Keep CSP and script host policy validated before debugging business logic.
- Prefer campaign embed over entry ID when minimizing user friction is a priority.

## Chaining

- Product-level architecture and drift checks: [../SKILL.md](../SKILL.md)
