# Build Zoom Virtual Agent

Use this skill when the workflow embeds or wraps Zoom Virtual Agent, including web campaigns and mobile WebView integrations.

## Workflow

1. Identify the client: web, Android WebView, iOS WKWebView, campaign entry, support handoff, or knowledge-base sync pipeline.
2. Route to the platform skill before coding because event handling and native bridge behavior differ by client.
3. Confirm campaign, entry ID, allowed origins, lifecycle events, and support handoff behavior.
4. Keep user context updates, native URL handling, and handoff payloads explicit.
5. Debug by checking SDK readiness, campaign configuration, bridge injection, CSP, WebView lifecycle, and version drift.
