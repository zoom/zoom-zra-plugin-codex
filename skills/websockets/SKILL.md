# Setup Zoom WebSockets

Use this skill when the integration needs persistent Zoom event delivery instead of HTTP webhook callbacks. If normal webhook retries and delivery are enough, prefer `setup-zoom-webhooks`.

## Workflow

1. Confirm WebSockets are justified by latency, firewall, connection model, or deployment constraints.
2. Configure the app and event subscriptions for the required event stream.
3. Implement connection setup, authentication, heartbeat, reconnect, backoff, and shutdown handling.
4. Normalize events into the same internal contract used by webhook handlers when both are supported.
5. Add observability for connection state, reconnect count, event lag, and dropped messages.
6. Debug by isolating token/auth problems, app subscription settings, network proxies, TLS interception, and reconnect loops.
