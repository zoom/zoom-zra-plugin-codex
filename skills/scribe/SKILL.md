# Zoom AI Services Scribe

Use this skill for Zoom Scribe transcription pipelines over uploaded or stored media. If the user needs live meeting media, compare against RTMS or Meeting SDK bot workflows first.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the media source, size, language, expected latency, and whether fast mode or batch mode fits.
2. Set up Build-platform credentials and JWT handling separately from application transcription logic.
3. Design ingestion, chunking, retries, webhook callbacks, and persistence before connecting downstream AI workflows.
4. Implement a minimal transcription request and response parser, then add batching and operational monitoring.
5. Debug by checking credential audience, processing mode, media format, file size, backend timeout, and webhook delivery.
