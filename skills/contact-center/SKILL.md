# Build Zoom Contact Center App

Use this skill when the integration targets Zoom Contact Center rather than general meetings, chat, or phone. Route to the platform-specific skill once the client surface is clear.

## Workflow

1. Identify the channel and client: web, Android, iOS, campaign embed, video engagement, chat engagement, Virtual Agent handoff, or scheduled callback.
2. Confirm the lifecycle: initialization, engagement start, context retrieval, state changes, transfer or handoff, and cleanup.
3. Choose the platform reference before coding; Contact Center SDKs differ by event names, lifecycle hooks, and wrapper requirements.
4. Treat engagement context as shared state and validate how it flows into CRM, ticketing, analytics, or AI workflows.
5. Debug version drift by checking SDK version, documented event names, app settings, campaign configuration, and browser or mobile lifecycle behavior.
