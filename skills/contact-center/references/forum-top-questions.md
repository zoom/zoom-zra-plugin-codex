# Forum-Derived Top Questions (Contact Center)

Use this as a checklist of the most common recent Developer Forum asks for Zoom Contact Center integrations.

## Fast Routing Questions (Ask First)

- Surface: Contact Center app in Zoom client, web SDK/campaign embed, Smart Embed, or REST API workflow.
- Runtime: web vs Android vs iOS and exact SDK version.
- Auth context: app type, scopes, token owner, and Contact Center admin role.
- Resource target: queue/flow/engagement IDs and expected channel (`voice`, `video`, `chat`, callback).
- Failure proof: exact endpoint/event, full response code/message, and one representative payload.

## Smart Embed Login/Origin Problems

Common asks:
- Login popup completes but embed never receives session.
- Hosted environment fails while local HTML test works.

Answer pattern:
- Verify allowed domain configuration exactly matches production origin.
- Validate `origin` usage and `postMessage` contract assumptions.
- Check iframe/sandbox/CSP restrictions for hosted environments.
- Reproduce with a minimal page (embed only) to isolate app-layer interference.

## Token Works for Phone But Contact Center API Returns 401

Common asks:
- Same bearer token can call Phone endpoints but Contact Center endpoints return invalid token.

Answer pattern:
- Confirm Contact Center scopes are on the active token (not only app config).
- Confirm requester has Contact Center admin permissions in target account.
- Confirm account context did not drift (owner/admin reassignment can break behavior).
- Regenerate token after any scope/role changes.

## Event Gaps and State-Change Confusion

Common asks:
- `contact_center.user_status_changed` or engagement events appear missing.
- Documented event name does not fire as expected in a given lifecycle.

Answer pattern:
- Attach listeners before channel/session start.
- Verify event coverage for the specific channel and engagement phase.
- Confirm network/security layers are not blocking webhook deliveries.
- Add reconciliation logic instead of assuming every state transition emits one event.

## Recordings and Transcripts Edge Cases

Common asks:
- Recording rows exist but media/transcript is unavailable.
- Transcript download fails or payload differs from expectations.

Answer pattern:
- Check recording duration/status before download attempts.
- Handle not-ready and no-recording states explicitly.
- Retry with bounded backoff for newly completed engagements.
- Keep fallback handling for empty/partial recording metadata.

## Analytics Pagination Repeats First Page

Common asks:
- `next_page_token` loops the same records in historical analytics endpoints.

Answer pattern:
- Keep all filter params stable while paging.
- Use token exactly as returned; do not mutate sort/filter inputs mid-stream.
- Add duplicate-page detection and stop conditions in client code.

## Data Availability Boundaries

Common asks:
- Access to in-progress chat messages or other live interaction internals.

Answer pattern:
- Distinguish near-real-time events from post-engagement reporting APIs.
- Set expectations early when an in-progress data surface is unavailable.
- Design workflows around available lifecycle events and finalized engagement data.
