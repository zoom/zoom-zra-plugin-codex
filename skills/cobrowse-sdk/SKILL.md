# Zoom Cobrowse SDK

Use this skill after the support workflow is clearly a browser co-browsing experience. If the user is still choosing between Zoom Contact Center, Virtual Agent, Video SDK, or Cobrowse, route through `start` or `plan-zoom-product` first.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the role model: customer page, agent console, session initiation, and how the PIN or link is handed off.
2. Check auth and session setup before UI work: tokens, allowed origins, environment variables, and SDK loading.
3. Design privacy controls early: masking rules, blocked elements, remote-assist permission boundaries, and audit requirements.
4. Implement the minimal lifecycle first: initialize, start or join, subscribe to events, reconnect, and end.
5. Add advanced capabilities only after the base session is stable: annotations, multi-tab persistence, custom PINs, and remote assist.
6. When debugging, isolate browser support, CORS/CSP, token generation, third-party cookie behavior, and SDK event errors.
